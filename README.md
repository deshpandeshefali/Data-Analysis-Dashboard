# Data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Description

This project involved creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze a real-world dataset, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The single-page dashboard showcases key insights about user responses, preferences, and salary data.

## Objective

The main objective was to clean and transform raw survey data, analyze user responses, and create a clear, interactive dashboard to highlight trends in job titles, preferred programming languages, salary distribution and averages, and user demographics like country and industry.

## Dataset
<a href="">Dataset</a>

## Questions Answered (Insights Uncovered):

1. Common job titles and preferred programming languages in the dataset 
2. Salary trends through calculated averages 
3. Industry and country-wise participation patterns 

## Process

Data Acquisition: A real-world dataset was downloaded for analysis.
Data Cleaning Process:
Removed 4 empty columns.
Cleaned text-based columns like "Which title suits you perfectly?" and "Which is your favorite programming language?" using delimiter splitting.
Processed salary data by splitting the "Current Salary" column using delimiters and created a new custom column for a realistic salary estimate by averaging two columns.
Cleaned location and industry data by applying the same delimiter-splitting method to "Which country do you live in?" and "Which industry do you work in?".
Visualization: Once data cleaning was complete, visualizations were developed using Power BI features such as bar charts, pie charts, donuts, and cards.

## Insights

Cleaner visuals revealed underlying trends and patterns more clearly than the raw data.
The project helped in understanding how to derive insights from raw data.

## Conclusion 

The project successfully demonstrated the process of turning raw data into insightful stories through data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualization using Power BI Desktop, Power Query Editor, and DAX. The dashboard provides clear trends regarding job roles, programming language preferences, salary distribution, and user demographics.
